--What each script controls:

1. GameManager: Accumulating scores
2. RiverSpawner: Spawns tiles of river as the player moves forward 
3. RiverTile: Destroys old tiles. Creates and destroys coins. 
4. Coin： Defines destroy behavior and turn speed of coins
5. Ship Movement: Controls movement of the ship. Ship speeds up as more points are accumulated.
6. Camera Follow: Makes the camera follow the ship.


Potential Next Steps:
- Update art assets
- Define boundary of the sailing path
- Introduce more types/shapes of tiles that a curvey sailing path can be generated. Or use predefined path instead.
- Add timer to the mini game: player has x seconds to travel the island
